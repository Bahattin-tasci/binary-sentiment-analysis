# binary-sentiment-analysis
The dataset that worked on in this project is the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The
dataset contains movie reviews annotated with binary sentiment labels: positive or negative.
The dataset is provided as a CSV file with two columns:
• review: The review.
• sentiment: Either positive or negative.
Given a movie review, the goal is to predict whether the review is positive or negative.
The dataset contains 50,000 reviews about movies (positive 25,000, negative 25,000).
•	My task in this project was to implement Naive Bayes for sentiment classification 
and evaluate and compare the performance of my model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
